    <div id="situation">
        <p>Now that Summer has secured a full-time job right after graduation, she is now contemplating if the work she does is meaningful to her community. And whether or not it connects to a wider majority of people rather than the company's desired target audience. She is wondering if there are also more designers of different backgrounds and ethnicity that recieve the recoginition they deserve. She wonders if there is a website or online community that directly supports and acknowledges designers' stories and work.</p>
