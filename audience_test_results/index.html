        <p>For my audience test results, I learned that the process in itself is very important to making a good product. I'm glad that Glenda took the time to outreach on our behalf to find users that could test our website. The feedback they gave while using the website and after the testing made a big impact on the way we designed afterwards. We took their feedback into consideration and improved our website and hopefully the experience too!</p>
        <p>There were various feedback, but for more portion, when users were using the map, they were able to navigate pretty clearly and find the page about the designers. They didn't however quickly find the "More Info" tab which was quite important to be used as a directory.The audience definitely wanted the icons to be bigger and the "Key" to be clickable. I will try to implement the feedback as mentioned to give a better user experience. But I'm glad overall they initially enjoyed the experience and understood our intention for the website.</p>
