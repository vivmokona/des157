    <p>When it comes to word, "Diversity," I can't help but think of race, and ethnicity. It is a very relevant topic because of the highly-strung political and everyday events that occur even now in the 21st century.
    </p>
    <p>While on the topic of race, I think of how the color of our skin can decide our "fate." There is police brutality and blacks are being targeted and even shot to death instead of more reasonably handled with less extreme measures.
    </p>
    <p>Another aspect of diversity the word brings up is usability for everyone. Designers need to design for everyone in mind. No matter your skin color or possible disability. I think by designing for those dealing with everyday problems, universal design would follow too.
    </p>
    <p>Although I am still brainstorming on what it means to be diverse or problems I can tackle under the realm of "diversity." I do want to focus more on race and expanding others' knowledge that skin color and how others look is just surface level.
