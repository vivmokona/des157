        <p>In this website, they have small profiles of designers of color. There is a brief biography of each designer and they may or may not have a picture of them included. You can click on the icons on the "card" whether that be their Twitter or their portfolio website. At first I thought if you click on the "card" it would lead to their website as it took up the biggest amount of space. Since it didn't activate anything, later then I tried the icons. I like this concept, however I realize that there are only profiles of 38 people in total. There are options to suggest more designers of color. There is also an option to "Donate a Coffee" to the person who is running the page. This idea and website has potential, but it as a campaign it does not have a lot of momentum as the People of Color in Tech website. This website definitely has better user interface because immediately I know that each box is clickable. The moment I click it, it leads  me to another page and it is an article on the person. I found this more profound as the audience can learn more about the Person in Tech. It is also more sociable as there are links to external social platforms and a comment section at the end of the article. I think this is great because you can get others to interact with the author and even other people interested in this website and connect people to people. Along with this website I like how everything is kept in this website. And there is a navigation bar on top where people can return or visit other parts of the page. Overall I think People in Tech did a more effective job in bringing more awareness about people in color and their stories.</p>
