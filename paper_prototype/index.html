        <p>Through this paper prototype, I most definitely learned how people interact with my website. There were points of confusion because there was lack of text from me as a designer to help prompt the users. It doesn't hurt to add a little bit of text at some points to prompt the user what to do. It was pretty cool seeing users "click" through the website and have them navigate through pretty well. I am most definitely taking this trick of paper prototyping as a tool in my toolkit for web prototyping.</p>
