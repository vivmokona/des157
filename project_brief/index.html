        <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
        <p>My topic is about creating a platform for designers to connect with one another. And if they aren't a designer they can look for designers nearby them to hire. The task it accomplishes is knowledge as it is location base, so people for are searching for designers can find them and there will be data visualization of where the designers are. They will be color-coded by what kind of field of design they are. </p>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>My target audience is niche, it would be those who are designers and/or looking for designers. The age group is probably from 13 years old and older. If they need to look up designers, this is the platform/website for them. </p>

    <section id="goals">
        <h2>Goals of the Project</h2>
        <p>The goals of the project is to connect designers based on location. Say if someone is looking for a designer, it would be easier for them to find someone local if they want to work with them in person rather than communicating constantly over the web. I hope the audience can enjoy the experience and find that this is a helpful tool they can use to find designers and even input themselves if they want to. The goal for me is to challenge myself and learn how to use a library, specifically Mapbox, which is a lot more challenging than it seemed, however I am willing to take it on.</p>
