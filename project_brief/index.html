        <p>This is my visual research on similar types of maps that are of website view. Where they have a certain type of designer's location, their profile picture, and their ranking. I don't want to do a ranking system as I just want to have a way for data visualization. </p>

        <p>Here are mobile view of what the map app could potentially look like. Where it tracks your location and gives you closer search of who is in your area that could design for you. Although both moodboards give off the impression of being minimalistic, I believe that is alright because we need the information to stand out not so much the visual aspect which comes secondary.</p>
