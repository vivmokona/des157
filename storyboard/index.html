        <p>The people involved in this website are designers from around the world. They will all have profiles that allow them to talk about their design emphasis and their story. In order to allow viewers to view the map more easily and for me to categorize (besides based on location), designers can fill out the search form to find them through certain limited categorizes. The task this accomplishes are allowing those who are looking for local designers to more easily find them. And secondly it allows designers to get exposure and potential job offerings as their portfolios & social media links will be attached. Lastly, it can let others better know the designer's background through the story they tell. It is also interactive in that viewers can also input their own information too and be included in this database as well.</p>
        <p>Results from the rapid prototyping is that I learned I would need to access another library called Firebase in order t o save people's information. However if I don't have the capability to do that, I could use a simplier solution which is local storage. Since there's a lot of components to my website I do need to get the geography library down so I can customize more information onto it and have it be activated through the search engine.</p>
